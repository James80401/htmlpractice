          <h2> Cities where I have lived</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Olney, MD.  Eventually I left to move to Fairfield, CA
            to live in the west.  I left Fairfield for Sacramento in order to live
            in a bigger town.  I briefly moved back to Olney, MD and then made my
            way to Erie, CO (back to the west).  After living there for 5 years I
            moved to Fort Collins, CO to go to school at CSU.

          <h2>The top 3 cities I would like to visit</h2>
          <p>
            I would like to go to Seattle since I've never been to Washington
            state.  I like Montana and have heard Missoula is a beautiful place
            in the mountains.  I've always wanted to go to Crested Butte to hike
            during wildflower season.
